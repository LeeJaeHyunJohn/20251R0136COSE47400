\begin{abstract}
    In this project, we implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model is based on a modified ResNet-50 architecture, where we filled in the forward function and integrated the training/testing pipeline. We trained the model using the cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. After tuning hyperparameters and completing 500 iterations, our final model achieved a test accuracy of \textbf{81.18\%}, which surpasses the target benchmark of 80\%. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of residual connections and deep CNNs for image classification tasks.
