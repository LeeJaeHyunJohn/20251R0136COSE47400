\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Among various CNN architectures, ResNet has demonstrated remarkable performance by introducing residual learning, allowing for the training of much deeper networks.

In this project, we implement and train a ResNet-50 architecture on the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely-used benchmark for image classification. The goal of this assignment is to understand the internal structure of ResNet-50 and verify its performance through proper training and evaluation.
